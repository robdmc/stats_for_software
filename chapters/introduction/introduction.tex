\chapter{Introduction}
This document is a collection of various statistical equations that should
serve as a useful resource for building statistical software.  In particular,
it should be a useful reference for maintaining the django-brain software
package created for my current employer, Ambition.

It is assumed throughout, that the reader has some familiarity with the
statistical concepts and notation involved.  Think of this document as a
collection of statistical facts that have been assembled from various sources,
or derived where necessary.
