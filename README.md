Stats For Software
===

A personal (and maybe correct?) set of notes.
---

This repo contains the tex for generating a paper that serves as a reference
for building statistical software.  It is basically a collection of formulae
from various sources pulled together into one document for easy access.

The document covers a few common probability distributions and provides
practical formula for manipulating them in ways that are useful for building
software tools.

I basically wrote this document to serve as a note to myself.  Because of
this, it is quite terse, and will not be an easy read for anyone not already
quite familiar with the described probability distributions.
